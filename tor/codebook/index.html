					<p>This document describes how NZ Police Tactical Options Reporting data was analysed to produce various charts.</p>

					<p>I used my <a href="https://github.com/Cipscis/charter" target="_blank">Charter</a> data analysis library to load and process the data, and to produce all the charts in this document.</p>

					<p>The charts were produced based on three sources of Tactical Options Reporting (TOR) data released by New Zealand Police under the Official Information Act (OIA).</p>

					<p>TOR data records how NZ Police used force, with certain exceptions:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Presentation of tasers or firearms by the Armed Offenders Squad (AOS) or Special Tactics Group (STG)</li>
						<li>Prior to 2018, events in which someone died</li>
					</ul>

					<p>For information regarding how Police record their use of force in the TOR database, please see the document <a href="../references/Use of Force Overview Reporting.pdf" target="_blank">Use of Force Overview - Reporting (PDF)</a>. This document was extracted from the NZ Police Intranet on 23 August 2019, and <a href="https://fyi.org.nz/request/10536-use-of-force-and-police-dogs-chapter-of-the-police-manual#incoming-39362" target="_blank">released by Police</a> under the OIA on 26 August 2019.</p>

					<p>This Police guideline contains some important caveats regarding when Police do and don't record certain types of force. In particular, uses of "open hand" don't include pushing a person unless that person falls, and uses of "handcuff/restraint" are only recorded if it is used with "pain compliance" or if it is used alongside another tactical option:</p>

					<blockquote>
						<h3>Employees who use force must report</h3>

						<h4>Shows of force</h4>

						<p>Shows of:</p>

						<ul>
							<li>a TASER (i.e. presentation, laser painting or arcing)</li>
							<li>A firearm.</li>
						</ul>

						<p>To be reported on: <strong>Standard TOR</strong></p>

						<p><strong>Note: Excluding</strong> Armed Offenders Squad or Special Tactics Group shows of a TASER or a firearm and shows of force during training.</p>

						<h4>Uses of force</h4>

						<p><span class="text-decoration: underline;">Uses</span> of:</p>

						<ul>
							<li>communication, but <strong>only</strong> when used with one or more of the tactical options below, and <strong>only</strong> the first time it is used</li>
							<li>
								metal or plastic handcuffs, a waist restraint belt, and a leg restraint &mdash; vehicle:
								<ul>
									<li><strong>with</strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">pain compliance</span></li>
									<li><strong>without</strong> pain compliance, but <strong>only</strong> when handcuffs, a waist restraint belt, and a leg restraint &mdash; vehicle are used with another reportable tactical option</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>a spitting hood</li>
							<li>a restraint chair</li>
							<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">empty hand techniques</span> <strong>excluding</strong> touching, guiding, escorting, lifting, and pushing where a person does not fall to the ground</li>
							<li>O C spray (spraying)</li>
							<li>a baton (striking)</li>
							<li>a weapon of opportunity, e.g. a Police torch</li>
							<li>a Police dog when the subject is bitten and/or otherwise injured</li>
							<li>a TASER by discharge and/or contact stun</li>
							<li>a sponge round</li>
							<li>a firearm (discharge).</li>
						</ul>

						<p>To be reported on: <strong>Standard TOR</strong></p>

						<p>
							<strong>Notes:</strong><br />
							<strong>Excluding</strong> any use of force during training.<br />
							Unintentional or unauthorised TASER or firearms discharges must be reported in an Unintentional/Unauthorised Discharge form.

					<p>Each individual TOR report records one officer using force against one person. If two officers use force against one person, this will be recorded as two separate TOR events.</p>

						<p>On 30 November 2016, Emmy Rākete requested information from Police under the OIA, including:</p>

						<blockquote>
							<p>Provide all raw data being used in the creation of the biannual tactical options research report for 1 July &ndash; 31 December 2016.</p>

						</blockquote>

						<p>In their response on 22 December 2016, Police refused the request under <a href="http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1982/0156/latest/whole.html#DLM64785" target="_blank">section 18(e) of the OIA</a>, asserting that the requested information did not exist. They also explained:</p>

						<blockquote>
							<p>a technical fault occurred with the Tactical Options Reporting (TOR) database which has delayed the production of the report on the use of tactical options in 2015. The technical fault has been fixed, however, there are carry-on issues which are still being resolved.</p>

						</blockquote>

						<p>On 18 January 2017, <a href="https://fyi.org.nz/request/5039-tactical-options-research-report#incoming-16673" target="_blank">Police acknowledged</a> that Ms Rākete considered two matters in her request to be outstanding, and extended her request to 20 February 2017.</p>

						<p>On 16 March 2017, NZ Police sent <a href="https://fyi.org.nz/request/5039/response/17868/attach/4/Rakete%20Emilie%2016%2011336%20reply.pdf" target="_bank">a further response</a>, in which they acknowledged that they had been informed by the Ombudsman that Ms Rākete had laid a complaint because Police had not responded to two parts of her request, including the part asking for raw TOR data.</p>

						<p>In this response, Police explained that they had refused Ms Rākete's request for data being used in the creation of the TOR report to cover July-December 2016 because no such report was being created, and the data covering July-December 2016 was incomplete.</p>

						<p>However, Police also said they had reconsidered Ms Rākete's request for raw data, and released TOR data covering 1 July &ndash; 31 December 2016 in the following spreadsheet:

						<p><a href="../data/2016/jul-dec/170202 RAKETE 16 11336 TOR xlsx.xlsx" target="_blank">170202 RAKETE 16 11336 TOR xlsx.xlsx</a></p>

						<p>This spreadsheet contains a "Notes" sheet detailing how the export was created and what fields had been removed or recoded:</p>

						<blockquote>
							<p>The export was created using the following search criteria</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Incident start date = 1/07/2016</li>
								<li>Incident end date = 31/12/2016</li>

								Caveats:<br />The records provided in this spreadsheet are derived from the Tactical Options Reporting (TOR) database which records the reportable use of force by Police officers. Each row is a "TOR event" which is the reportable use of one or more tactical options, by one officer, against one individual. Multiple TOR events can occur at one incident. TOR data does not include events where the use of force is associated with a fatality as these events are instead the subject of internal and external investigations.

						<p>The Notes sheet also included the following section. I have added emphasis:</p>

						<blockquote>
							<p>While this data could potentially be used to create a biannual report, this data is incomplete and has not been cleaned or coded for analysis or to correct any errors. Some columns have been removed or altered (as outlined above), pursuant to section 9(2)(a) of the Official Information Act 1982, to protect the privacy of natural persons. Given the incomplete and unreliable nature of this data, Police takes no responsibility for its accuracy and correctness, and advises that it is incomplete. <strong>Police requests that if you publish this data in any form, you attach a proviso noting that Police have communicated to you that this information is raw data which has not been checked and which is therefore incomplete and unreliable</strong>. Furthermore, Police will not be liable for any loss or damage arising directly or indirectly from reliance on the data or information presented in the spreadsheet.</p>

						<p>On 16 September 2017, I requested information from Police under the OIA, including:</p>

						<blockquote>
							<p>TOR data for the 1 January - 30 June 2017 reporting period, in the same format as was released for the July - December 2016 reporting period.</p>

							<cite><a href="https://fyi.org.nz/request/6558-tactical-options-reporting-data-january-june-2017">OIA request: Tactical Options Reporting Data January-June 2017</a> | Mark Hanna</cite>
						</blockquote>

						<p>I also asked that Police consider including some information that was redacted from the previous release:</p>

						<blockquote>
							<p>In the data released in March, the following information was withheld entirely "as they may contain free-text (including names)":</p>

							<ul>
								<li>Your [Reporter] Role</li>
								<li>[Subject] Role</li>
								<li>Relevant factors</li>
								<li>Subject Weapon</li>
								<li>Subject behaviours [for all Tactical Options]</li>

							<p>I would ask that you consider whether, as required by s9(2)(a) of the Official Information Act, it is *necessary* to withhold all of this information in order to protect the privacy of natural persons. I expect this is not the case, and it would be preferable if only that information which it is necessary to withhold for that reason should be withheld, rather than the entire content of these columns.</p>

							<p>I understand that this would likely require significantly more work before the data is fit for release. I would be happy to consult with you regarding this part of my request if necessary, to discuss potential compromises that will allow more of the data to be released without requiring a charge or being refused under s18(f) of the Official Information Act.</p>

						</blockquote>

						<p>On 25 September 2017, a Police employee consulted with me on refining this part of my request. She explained that manually reviewing the fields that had previously been redacted in this way would take a very long time, and proposed a compromise:</p>

						<blockquote>
							<p>in order to facilitate your request, Police are willing to recode some of these variables, so long as the total time required to prepare the dataset remains under one hour (in line with Ministry of Justice guidelines). As such, we would recode variables for which we already have a robust recoding technique established (but which has not yet been applied to this current dataset). This would likely include Subject relevant factors and subject weapon types.</p>

							<cite><a href="https://fyi.org.nz/request/6558-tactical-options-reporting-data-january-june-2017#incoming-21771">OIA Response</a> | NZ Police</cite>
						</blockquote>

						<p>I responded to clarify that I was most interested these columns being included:</p>

						<ul>
							<li>Subject Weapon</li>
							<li>Reason no warning [for all uses of TASER]</li>
							<li>Other tactic [type] [for all uses of Other tactics]</li>
						</ul>

						<p>I also said I would appreciate if the "Relevant factors" column could be included if Police had sufficient time.</p>

						<p>Police responded again to tell me what additional work they would be willing to do to allow more information to be included in the release:</p>

						<blockquote>
							<p>Based on your response Police are willing to recode the "Subject Weapon" and, if time permits, the "subject relevant factors" fields.</p>

							<p>For the "Other tactic" and "Reason no warning" fields, these are solely free-text fields which we do not currently have a recording process for. However due to the relatively low number of cases for each field we believe that we can redact any personal information that may exist in these cells, within the one-hour timeframe .</p>

							<p>During this process, it may be necessary to redact additional content in the free-text fields for reasons other than privacy (for example, under sections 6(c) or 9(2)(g)(i)). The reasons for any redaction will be noted in the cells.</p>

							<p>Also, please be aware that the content in the "Other tactic" fields are particularly prone to data entry errors. Police will not be investigating nor correcting or recoding any data errors.</p>

								During the period of this analysis, TOR data does not include events where the use of force is associated with a fatality, as these events are the subject of internal and external investigations."
